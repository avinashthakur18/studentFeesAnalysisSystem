Simple Python project that processes or analyzes fee data stored in `fee_data.csv`.

## Contents
- `app.py` — main application script
- `fee_data.csv` — input CSV data

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies (if any) with pip. Example:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

> Note: This project currently has no `requirements.txt`; add one if your project needs external packages.

## Usage
Run the main script:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Development
- Create a virtual environment and activate it (recommended):

  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # on Windows
  ```

- Run or edit `app.py` as needed.

## Git
A `.gitignore` is included to keep environment and IDE files out of the repository.

## License
MIT License — add or change as needed.

If you want, I can add a `requirements.txt`, commit these files, and push to GitHub next.
